# BWH-001-Tracking-Camera
This is the central dev readme for this project, it will be split up into a few parts as required for the overall project.

The rough plan is:
1. Get a raspberry pi recording and conceptually tracking movement.
2. Get the pi streaming video data to an app via local network connections.
3. Mount whole rig to plywood and do a dry (literally) run.
4. Finalise mounting/waterproofing proccess
5. Production!

Documentation is important!


## Todo:
First phase procurement
Raspberry Pi code
App Dev

Worklist:
Ben/John/James:
Investigate how Raspberry Pi recieves image data from the camera and what proccessing options we have. Sampling is the best bet for control, while streaming should prioritise framerate over fideity (debatable).

Ben:
Investigate enclosure and mounting for wet/humid environments, particularly electric motor issues.

John:
If you have money, discuss procurement.

James:
Investigate data streaming to android/ios (simple apps are enough, the two highest priorities are live viewing then recording)


Next Steps:
Meet up soon!
